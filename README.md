# Debloat Windows 10

This project collects Powershell scripts which help to *debloat* Windows 10,
tweak common settings and install basic software components.

I develop those scripts on a Windows 10 Professional 64-Bit virtual machine.
Please let me know if you encounter any issues with other Windows 10 versions.

Note that **there is no undo**, I recommend only using these scripts on a fresh
install (including updates). Test everything after running them before
continuing with something else. Also there is no guarantee that everything will
work after future updates since I cannot predict what Microsoft will do next.

## Download Latest Version

Code located in the `master` branch is under development (for now).

## Execution

Enable execution of PowerShell scripts:

    PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Unblock PowerShell scripts and modules within this directory:

    PS > ls -Recurse *.ps1 | Unblock-File
    PS > ls -Recurse *.psm1 | Unblock-File

## Usage

1. Install all available updates for your system.
2. Edit the scripts to fit your need.
3. Run the scripts
4. `PS > Restart-Computer`

## Interactivity

The scripts are designed to run without any user-interaction. Modify them
beforehand. If you want a more interactive approach check out
[DisableWinTracking](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking) from
[10se1ucgo](https://github.com/10se1ucgo).

## Liability

**All scripts are provided as is and you use them at your own risk.**

## Contribute

I would be happy to extend the collection of scripts. Just open an issue or
send me a pull request.
